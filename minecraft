## this is about my minecraft skills

I am proficient in 1.8.9 combat. I can rod combo, aim with a bow and hold combos.
I can reach 15 CPS on a good day but i stick to 7 for better aiming.
I can speedbridge up to 3.3 ish blocks a second.
I can do terraforming for landscapes. I can build with that.
I can sufficiently play known minigames such as bedwars and skywars. 
I am very into communication with others because that is vital in a teamwork based game.
I am proficient in parkour. I am far from the best but for mobility i can serve well.
